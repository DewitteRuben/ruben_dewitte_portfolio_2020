# Decoration marketplace

## Introduction

There are many online marketplaces currently out there: Amazon, eBay, Google Express, etc.
Many of these marketplaces sell a wide variety of items, there are some who target a more specific audience.

For example, Etsy, it is an e-commerce focused on handmade or vintage items and craft supplies.
Other than Etsy there is Vinted, an e-commerce that focusses on selling (and swapping) of clothes and accessoires.

I had the idea to target another nieche audience. Inspired by the german retail store 'Depot' that sells mostly decoration-related articles,
I wanted to create a proof of concept of an online marketplace where people can buy and sell decoration-related goods.

*<Small>The main goal of this project was to challenge myself and to showcase my skillset</Small>*

<br/>

## Development

### Scope
* Items divided by category, subcategory, etc.
    * Categories accessible by URL, e.g.: /decoration/vases-and-flowers/wreath/flowers
* Ability to sort / filter items (by price, popularity and date)
* User accounts (Login, registration)
    * Ability to view edit and delete your own profile 
    * Ability to view other profiles
* Ability to add, edit, remove items 
* Shopping cart / Wishlist
* Paypal implementation

### Design

I chose to go with a minimalistic approach as an online webshop/marketplace should be clear and simple in use.<br/>Design was made using <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figma</a>.

<LightboxCarousel width={600} images={[decoworldHomePageDesign, decoworldLoginPageDesign]} />

### Tech stack
